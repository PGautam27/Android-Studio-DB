# Android-Studio-DB
Ya here I concentrated on database. Cause I am using kotlin, I had an option to use rooms. It's like SQLite, it uses SQL queries to add and remove data's. Ya I still haven't included the remove option in the app.
But it does what I wanted it to do. It accepts the data from the user and dumps it into the database and then shows it as a card. Or in other words the user can view it as well.
